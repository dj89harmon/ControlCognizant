# ControlCognizant
This is my senior capstone project at Bellevue College.  I was part of a team of four selected by a sponsoring company to design a web application to allow enterprise-level companies to track their compliance with common security protocols such as NIST, HITRUST, and GDPR.  I was tasked with leading the development of the user interface, which was built using React.  This interacted with our Spring Boot back end and PostgreSQL database stored in the cloud using AWS to allow for CRUD operations to be performed and displayed accurately and cleanly.  OAuth was used for user authentication.  We used an Agile methodology to complete the project, with sprints, weekly standup meetings, and multiple progress checks each week.
